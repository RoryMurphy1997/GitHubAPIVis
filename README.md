# GitHubAPIVis
Pull data from GitHub API and create a webpage with a visualisation of said data

Simply download "Interrogate API.R", open R, set working directory to wherever you downloaded "Interrogate API.R" and run the following code:

source("Interrogate API.R", echo = TRUE)

This will run the code necessary to produce the visualisation, installing the needed packages if they have not been installed.
