# GitHubAPIVis
Pull data from GitHub API and create a webpage with a visualisation of said data

Requires installing the preview release of RStudio v1.2 of RStudio (you need this version of RStudio to take advantage of various integrated tools for authoring D3 scripts with r2d3). Link can be found here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/

After this, simply download "Interrogate API.R", open R, set working directory to wherever you downloaded "Interrogate API.R" and run the following code:

source("Interrogate API.R", echo = TRUE)

This will run the code necessary to produce the visualisation, installing the needed packages in R if they have not been installed on your device.
